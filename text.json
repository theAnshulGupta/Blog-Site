    "body": "There were little things that she simply could not stand. The sound of someone tapping their nails on the table. A person chewing with their mouth open. Another human imposing themselves into her space. She couldn't stand any of these things, but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldn't stand which topped all of them combined. Turning away from the ledge, he started slowly down the mountain, deciding that he would, that very night, satisfy his curiosity about the man-house. In the meantime, he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink, after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge, and explore among the foothills a bit before his nap-time, which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky. At that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside, so all of the animals, with one accord, had decided it should be the hour for their mid-day sleep. Josh had spent year and year accumulating the information. He knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field, Josh would be the one to call. The problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it. Years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic. It's not his fault. I know you're going to want to, but you can't blame him. He really has no idea how it happened. I kept trying to come up with excuses I could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened, but the more I tried, the more I could see none of them would work. He was going to get her wrath and there was nothing I could say to prevent it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas..."

    "body": "Growing up we had the best dog ever. He was half English Bulldog and just the funniest guy with amazing comedic timing. He didn't look like an English bully at all though. He looked like a pitbull, at the height of pitbull fear in the 90's. Like many Bulldogs, he was fascinated by wheels. He loved to attack skateboard wheels, big wheels, etc. One of his favorite things was when the UPS truck would stop on our street. It got to the point that he would hear it coming and wait at the window. He got out once and chased one, but we caught him before he caught the truck. For 10 years, the UPS truck was his love and his nemesis. Anyway... We were on a family vacation and had to cut it short because he got very sick while at the kennel. We took him to his vet and learned that he had a very aggressive form of lung cancer (he had no symptoms until he was at the kennel. Had just been to the vet a few months prior). We had to euthanize him that day. He was that bad off. It was truly one of the most unexpected depressing events of my life. I took him outside for his final walk. Right across from the vet's office was a Wendy's (fast food restaurant). As I was walking him, and crying over how frail and sick he seemed, a UPS truck pulled right up to us. The driver jumped out to grab his lunch. Well...you know how they leave the doors open on those trucks? He perked up. He looked at the truck. He looked at me. I said 'Ok, go for it' and as weak as he was, he pulled me over to the truck. Hopped up into the passenger side and checked the whole thing out, tail wagging. Got out and got inspect all 4 tires. For his last hurrah, my sweet, goofy boy finally caught his UPS truck."

    "body": "Polly Willis looked at the tattered piano in her hands and felt stable. She walked over to the window and reflected on her pretty surroundings. She had always loved deprived Oxford with its tired, tough trees. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel stable. Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Gemma Doop. Gemma was a callous patient with short warts and ginger fingernails. Polly gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a gracious, delightful, beer drinker with sticky warts and pretty fingernails. Her friends saw her as a violet, vivacious volcano. Once, she had even jumped into a river and saved a high owl. But not even a gracious person who had once jumped into a river and saved a high owl, was prepared for what Gemma had in store today. The sun shone like dancing maggots, making Polly calm. As Polly stepped outside and Gemma came closer, she could see the tasteless glint in her eye. \"I am here because I want a phone number,\" Gemma bellowed, in an intuitive tone. She slammed her fist against Polly's chest, with the force of 9622 aardvarks. \"I frigging love you, Polly Willis.\" Polly looked back, even more calm and still fingering the tattered piano. \"Gemma, Is that real leather,\" she replied. They looked at each other with happy feelings, like two raspy, regurgitated rats skipping at a very predatory carol service, which had flute music playing in the background and two stupid uncles bouncing to the beat. Polly studied Gemma's short warts and ginger fingernails. Eventually, she took a deep breath. \"I'm sorry, but I can't give you a phone number,\" she explained, in pitying tones. Gemma looked stable, her body raw like a bloody, big blade. Polly could actually hear Gemma's body shatter into 9946 pieces. Then the callous patient hurried away into the distance. Not even a drink of beer would calm Polly's nerves tonight."
